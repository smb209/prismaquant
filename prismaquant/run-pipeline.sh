# run-pipeline.sh — end-to-end PrismaQuant pipeline: probe → cost →
# allocator → native compressed-tensors export → vLLM validate.
#
# Usage:
#   MODEL_PATH=/path/to/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B \
#   WORK_DIR=./dq-runs/qwen36 \
#   FORMATS=NVFP4,FP8_DYNAMIC,BF16 \
#   TARGET_BITS=4.75 \
#   VISUAL_FORMAT=BF16 \
#   CALIBRATION_MODALITY=text-only \
#   ./prismaquant/run-pipeline.sh
#
# VISUAL_FORMAT accepts any format registry name allowed by the target
# serving profile and applies to visual-encoder Linears on multimodal models.
# In text-only calibration mode it's the Phase 1 uniform override for every
# visual Linear. In multimodal mode it's the fallback applied to un-probed
# visual Linears the allocator's Fisher-driven DP didn't touch (plus the
# graceful OOM fallback on 122B-scale VLMs that can't fit the whole model in
# RAM for the multimodal pass).
#
# CALIBRATION_MODALITY (text-only | multimodal):
#   - text-only (default): body-only streaming probe + cost. Visual
#     shards emit empty pickles; allocator stamps all visual Linears
#     with --visual-format uniformly.
#   - multimodal: also runs a non-streaming second probe pass with
#     image+text calibration (synthetic stub by default; set MM_DATASET
#     to a HuggingFace dataset id to use real images). The allocator
#     treats visual Linears as regular DP candidates when real Fisher
#     stats are present. Requires ~full-model RAM; falls back to
#     text-only behavior automatically on OOM.
#
# Memory note: probe + cost peak around 90 GB on a 35B model under
# BF16 calibration. The watchdog in incremental_measure_quant_cost
# aborts cleanly on swap pressure rather than OOM-killing the host.
#
# MTP is folded into the incremental probe + cost as a built-in shard;
# mtp.* tensors are measured in the same pass as the body and land in
# the same probe/cost pickles. No separate MTP stages.

# What those gates were protecting is a property of the RENDER, not of the
# objective: the render that produces the allocator's cost must be the render
# the exporter ships. The right key already existed —
# `measure_quant_cost._cost_render_uses_imatrix` decides it per FORMAT FAMILY
# (the CB families always weighted, gguf tracking PRISMAQUANT_GGUF_IMATRIX) —
# the gates just did not use it, which is why `COST_MODE=local` had to stand
# in for "weighted render" and blocked two objectives for no reason of their
# own.
#
#   COST_RENDER=inline      -> the cost stage calls the family's own qdq:
#                              faithful by construction.
#   COST_RENDER=cached-menu -> faithful iff the ProductionWeightCache render
#                              applies the same imatrix. Since CB Milestone C

#                              it can, given the harvested vector — so the

#                              and this block records that requirement.
#
# NOT a promotion: AURA-on-CB is now REACHABLE, not recommended. Its −38% /
# −17.9% wins are native-lane results and CB's error surface (VQ + the expert
# route-flip floor) is a different animal; it stays opt-in pending its own

# Policy §1's production problem is "minimize predicted quality loss SUBJECT TO
# exact bytes <= B, p95 TTFT <= SLO_prefill, p95 ITL <= SLO_decode_itl,
# p05 TPS >= SLO_decode_tps, resident + KV + peak_scratch <= device budget".
# Latency is NEVER blended into the objective: there is no lambda and no
# phase-weighted serve_ms. An assignment that misses an SLO is INFEASIBLE and
# is removed from the candidate set; the objective stays minimum predicted
# Delta-loss over the survivors, with the existing ratchet tie-break intact.
#
# ALL OF THESE ARE OFF BY DEFAULT. Leave SERVE_DISPATCH_TABLE empty and the
# allocator behaves exactly as it did before P5c, with a provenance stamp in
# selection.json recording that no serving constraint was evaluated (so an
# artifact never implies a latency claim it did not make).
#
# SERVE_DISPATCH_TABLE — measured per-(format-family, phase, M-regime, lane)
#   serving costs, every row citing its source document, date, GPU identity,
#   measured quantity, units and the derivation that produced the ratio. A row
#   without a source is refused at load. An EXAMPLE table built only from
#   published Gridbook measurements ships in-tree; it is PROPOSAL DATA, not a
#   qualified serving model for your hardware:
#     prismaquant/serve_dispatch_tables/gridbook_gb10_2026-08-01.example.json
# SERVE_WORKLOAD_MIX — which M-regimes the workload actually runs, e.g.
#   "prefill:dense_prefill_1400=1.0,decode:decode_batch1=1.0". Per-phase
#   weights must sum to 1.0. There is deliberately no default: policy §1
#   forbids "a default workload mix hidden in the allocator".
# SLO_* / SERVE_DEVICE_BUDGET_BYTES — the operator's hard limits. Prefill and
#   decode are separate constraints because a format can move them in opposite
#   directions (FP8-CB measures 1.44x on dense prefill and at parity on
#   batch-1 decode).
# SERVE_KV_BYTES / SERVE_PEAK_SCRATCH_BYTES — operator inputs to the device
#   memory constraint. The allocator models resident WEIGHT bytes exactly and
#   models neither of these, so it will not guess them.
#
# Whatever these produce is PROPOSAL DATA. Per NATIVE-PARITY and policy §1,

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# [3c] AURA additivity report (re-vet R2 precondition (ii) / R3; the R2-vs-R19
# disagreement resolved as WIRED).
#
# AURA's one structural assumption is that per-Linear KL contributions ADD.
# This stage turns that assumption into a per-artifact NUMBER —
#   residual = measured_end_KL(assignment) - sum_i predicted_dloss_i
# with an honest stderr (exact per-probe when the cost rows carry
# x2_per_probe, else the independence lower bound) — instead of a two-model
# memory. It is a REPORT: it never fails the run, and it never changes an
# allocation.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT AT [2d]. The residual needs a concrete assignment,
# and none exists until the allocator has run (and, under
# validated-surrogate, until the frontier has been selected). This is the
# first point where layer_config.json is final under both selection modes.
#
# AURA_ADDITIVITY_GATE:
#   measure (DEFAULT, ruled 2026-07-30) — report from a measured KL this run
#                    already produced when there is one (validated-surrogate's
#                    frontier JSON, free), and otherwise run ONE bounded KL
#                    measurement of the final assignment against the SAME
#                    format-menu dW cache AURA costed on (AURA_COST_NSAMPLES x
#                    AURA_COST_SEQLEN). Robert's ruling on the R2 residue: the
#                    wiring's weak spot was that under SELECTION_MODE=surrogate
#                    an artifact carried a *prediction* and no residual, so
#                    AURA's one structural assumption stayed a two-model memory
#                    instead of a per-artifact number. Every AURA-default run
#                    now performs the eval and every artifact carries a real
#                    residual. It is still a REPORT — non-blocking, and it never
#                    changes an allocation.
#   auto           — the pre-ruling behaviour: report only from a measurement
#                    the run already made; otherwise record the predicted sum
#                    with measured_kl null and a status saying why. Zero added
#                    GPU.
#   0              — off.

  # a CB rung is the SAME imatrix-weighted render the exporter ships and the
  # standard ProductionWeightCache identity (cost == KL == bytes) holds on
  # this lane too. The `COST_MODE=local` restriction is therefore GONE,
  # replaced by the render-faithfulness assertion at the top of this file.
  # What is deliberately NOT promoted: render-score/AURA objectives on CB are
  # reachable but opt-in — their accuracy case is native-lane evidence and CB
  # has had no served objective A/B (that A/B, not the plumbing, is what would
  # justify a default).
  # There is also NO in-lane serving smoke: CB artifacts serve ONLY via the
  # separately released, immutable-pinned Gridbook runtime, so the
  # load+generate / served-KL gate runs in Gridbook's serving env, not here
  # (docs/lanes/nvfp4-cb/serve_prototype_0p6b.md). No rung is production-eligible
